  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>I like to play basketball because when I am playing the sound of the crowd gets me pumped up and with that energy I play better because these people are watching me show off my skills.</li>
  <li>I like to play football because when I was younger my older brothers would always bully me because I was smaller than all of them so I play so that I can get bigger so that when they try to do that they won't be able to.</li>
  <li>On the weekends me and my cousins play Black Ops 3 Zombies because all of us have the same intrest because when we play together we bond great.</li>
  <li>Me and my cousins like to go the mall because when we see other kids wearing something new and we like it we want it and we ask our parents if they can buy it for us.</li>
  <li>Me and my older brother like to take apart old iphones and but parts for them and fix them so we can give them to our little cousins or my dad.</li>
  <li>On the weekends me and my family love to go to SC Village a paintball park because when we go as a group we just go to have fun and not fight with people that we don't know.</li>
</ul>
